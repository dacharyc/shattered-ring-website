  I played Elden Ring for 2 hours with a notebook. I could barely make sense of my chicken scratches. I knew if I got 20 or 100 hours into the game, my notes would be a jumbled mess. That's what had happened with every D&D campaign where I've attempted to make notes about important NPCs, locations, or quests. 

  I wanted an iPhone app that would allow me to easily track NPCs, Locations, and Quests. I couldn't find one on the App Store, so I wrote one, modeled after a task tracker app. I designed it to be easy to enter, find, and update info about RPG games. It works great as a campaign tracker for D&D and other TTRPGs, too!

  As folks have started using the app, they've been requesting new features. Boss tracking is one of them, and I'm working on rolling out more fan-requested features. See the [FAQ](/faq/) for a list
  of current feature requests, and [follow Shattered Ring on Twitter](https://twitter.com/shattered_ring) to vote for the features you want to see in the app or find out what's coming in new releases.
