## Is there an Android version of Shattered Ring?

Shattered Ring is a fan-developed app written by an indie iOS developer.
However, so many folks have asked for an Android version that I've partnered
with an Android developer to bring you one. Coming soon! Follow 
[Shattered Ring on Twitter](https://twitter.com/shattered_ring) 
for updates, or check back!

## Does the app come pre-loaded with Elden Ring NPCs, Locations, and Quests?

Shattered Ring is designed to be a spoiler-free tracking app that lets users
manually enter NPCs, Locations, and Quests as they encounter them. It doesn't
come pre-populated with a checklist of entries by design. In addition to being
a choice to keep the app spoiler-free, it's also not pre-populated because some
folks might also use it as a D&D or other TTRPG tracker, so having preset data
wouldn't make sense for other games.

However, if there is enough demand for a feature like this, it's potentially 
something I could add. If this is something you'd like to see, send me an 
email or vote for it when I put up a Twitter poll to prioritize feature requests.

## Does the app update automatically based on game progress?

That would be really cool! But unfortunately, there are no publicly-available
APIs that would let me get updates from your gameplay. This level of integration
is something that [FromSoftware](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/) would need to provide.

## I'd like to see a feature - how can I request it?

I'm so thrilled and humbled to see other fans using and enjoying the app, and
to find out folks are interested in requesting features. Thank you for your
interest! 

For now, feel free to reach out to [Shattered Ring on Twitter](https://twitter.com/shattered_ring)
or send us an email via [the Support form](/contact/) to request a feature.
When I have time to add new features to the app, I'll put up a Twitter
poll to help me prioritize which features to add first.

Currently, features that have been requested include (updated March 13, 2022):

- Preload NPC, Location and Quests data for users to check off
- Support for adding photos to NPCs, Locations and Quests
- Add ordering for lists (alphabetical, and/or potentially the ability to move items in lists manually)
- Link characters/locations/quests to their respective Wiki entries
- Add the ability to track Bosses to the app
- Add the ability to track Regions, with Locations belonging to a Region
- Translate the Shattered Ring app to other languages

Feature Requests Completed:
- Add ability to to edit names of NPCs, Locations, and Quests: Release 1.1.0 adds the ability to edit names

I do intend to keep developing Shattered Ring as long as folks are interested
in using it, so I'm happy to hear any feature requests you might
have and hope to start shipping new features shortly!

## The app doesn't do what I want - how do I get a refund?

If you're not happy with Shattered Ring, you can request a
refund from Apple. See Apple Support for more details:
