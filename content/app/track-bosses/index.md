Track bosses in Elden Ring, another RPG game, or your regular D&D game. You 
can add notes for a boss, see the boss's location, and filter by 
defeated or undefeated bosses.

## View Bosses at-a-glance in the Boss list

From the Boss list, you can easily browse bosses and see at-a-glance which ones
you have defeated. You can view all bosses by default, or filter the list to see 
only defeated or undefeated bosses. A green crown icon at the right of a boss row 
indicates the boss is defeated.

The search field lets you find Bosses by name, _and_ it also searches the text of the 
notes you've added for each boss. Read online about a legendary piece of loot a boss
drops but aren't tough enough to beat it yet? Jot down the drop in the boss's notes
and you can find which boss dropped it later by searching for it.

## Track important Boss details

The Boss view is where you can store details about the bosses you're tracking. 

The top part of the boss view contains a clickable toggle to keep track of whether you've defeated the boss.

Below that, you'll see a boss's location, if you've added one. When you add a boss's location, you can 
choose from an existing [Location](/app/track-locations/), or create a new one. Bosses only have one location.

And finally, you'll see notes associated with your boss. You can add or edit notes from here. 
The note area is a scrollable field, so there's no end to how much text you can have in the notes 
for each boss.

## Easily enter new Bosses

Because Shattered Ring is a spoiler-free tracking app that does not come with pre-loaded data,
I've made it as easy as possible to add details while you play.

From the Boss list, click the plus icon in the upper-right corner of the screen to create a new boss. 

In the new boss form, you can add a name, flip a toggle if the boss is defeated, and hit the `Create Boss` button. You can also add notes when you create the boss, or you can go back later and add them when viewing boss details.

After you create the boss, you can go to the boss's detail view to add a location.

If you create the boss from the location view, the boss is automatically populated with the location whose view you created the boss from.
